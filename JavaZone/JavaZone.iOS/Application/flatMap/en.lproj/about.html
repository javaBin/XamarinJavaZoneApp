        <h1>flatMap for iOS</h1>
        
        <h2>Development</h2>
        
        <p>Source code for this application is available <a href="https://github.com/javaBin/ems-ios/">on github</a>. The only file not provided is a plist that has integration api keys (described in README.md).</p>
        
        <h3 class="about">Issues/Support</h3>
        
        <p>If you have a problem or suggestion - then please <a href="https://github.com/javaBin/ems-ios/issues">raise an issue on github</a>. Remember to include the build version: VERSION(bBUILD).</p>
        
        <h2>Tracking and logging</h2>
        
        <h3 class="about">Analytics</h3>
        
        <p>Tracking in the application logs what pages and views are open and how long data transfers are. It logs <b>no</b> personal information about you nor does it log more information about your device other than what hardware (iPhone, iPad) and what iOS version.</p>
        <p>This information will be used for two things. The main one is for working on improvements to the app itself. The other is at the end of the conference to provide an overall aggregate set of statistics on what was most popular (most favourites, most shared etc).</p>
        
        <h3 class="about">Crash reporting</h3>
        
        <p>We test the application but do not have a chance to replicate the load that it receives during an actual conference or on as many different devices that it will be used on during the conference. So - to catch bugs that cause application termination we're using a crash reporting framework.</p>
        
        <p>If the application does crash - then on next start you will be asked if you would like to send a crash report (you can choose to always send - if so then it remembers this). We'd really appreciate that you do so if you can. It will send information on what you were doing in the application and where you were. It will also send information on what hardware (iPhone/iPad) and iOS version. It will <b>not</b> send any personal information.</p>
